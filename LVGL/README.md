> [LVGL](https://lvgl.io/) (Light and Versatile Graphics Library) è la libreria grafica embedded gratuita e open source più popolare per creare splendide interfacce utente per qualsiasi MCU, MPU e tipo di display....

## Project Status
* Ready for a first reading
* Awaiting the latest corrections reported
* Ok for HTML
* Ok for LATEX/pdf (there are the same problems as the original version)
    * "Too deeply nested" simulated by prefixing "__"
* KO for epub (the order of the pages is random!)

## To (re)create translated files:
* Esecute (for the moment as Administrator!) the 'Recreate.bat' batch file.
    * Folders and links are recreated

## ToDo:
* Word version
* Epub version
* Investigate/Solve the Problem of "Missing character" and "Too deeply nested" in pdf
* How NOT to modify the original "lvgl" folder?
